<h1>Hello!</h1>

<h2> Welcome to my super awesome website!</h2>

<h3> Testing the different headers</h3>
<p> That's a paragraph, but HTML is hard...</p>

<p> In the morning, I wake up and I think "ratatatantanpolopo!" </p>

<p> 
  Let's try to add a link now:
  <a href="https://google.com">Link to Google.com</a>
  Tell me that the changes are working now?
  I want to execute JavaScript now: <script>window.location.href="https://google.com"</script>
</p>
